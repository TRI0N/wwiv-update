# wwiv-update
Automated Update Program for WWIV5

This program will update WWIV 5 BBS and will perform the following:<br>
1) Backup WWIV to a Zip file in your Documents.<br>
2) Download WWIV Latest or Specified Version to your Downloads.<br>
3) Patch WWIV 5 EXE's and DLL's along with Updating Require DLL in System32.<br>
4) Launch WWIV and Release Notes in Browser.<br>
<br>
Using WWIV-Update does not require 3rd Party Programs such as 7zip or wGet to update your WWIV. It's build entirely on the Microsoft Net Framework 4.5.x that is Required to run WWIV as is. In other words, if you're running WWIV under Windows you have everything already installed to use this automated update.<br>
<br>
Furthermore this Execute is not Directory Dependent. You can run it from any directory or from your Windows Desktop that hosts the BBS.<br>
<br>
What's Next? I will be making this into a Windows Based Application and not using Console. This will help with a few security issues that are in conflict with the Console Version.<br>
<br>
NOTICE! This Program Requires Administrative Access for the Following: The Ability to write the required .dll to System32 and to seek the install directory of your BSS. It DOES NOT MODIFY any other system dependent configurations.
